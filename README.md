# Maxillary-Sinus-Quantification
Computed Tomography-Based Volumetric Tool for Standardized Measurement of the Maxillary Sinus. Description of the automated tool using Matlab software, which was developed for quantifying the total and air-free volume of the maxillary sinus based on computed tomography images. The quantification tool seeks to standardize maxillary sinus volume measurements, thus allowing better comparisons and determinations of factors that influence maxillary sinus size. The automated tool utilized image processing techniques.  Please contact PhD. Diana Rodrigues de Pina (drpina@fmb.unesp.br) for additional information regarding this protocol.
